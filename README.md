# A Little Dog and A Garden Blog

What do you get when an aspiring software  and web developer has a background in landscaping? A garden blog. Add a cute little dog and a family and you get Little Dog Garden Blog. This blog hopefully will deliver helpful garden and landscaping tips as well as family friendly activities, tools of the trade, and popular gardens to visit. Future plans include games and how to videos.
